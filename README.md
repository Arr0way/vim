# NullMode's Personal vim Settings

## About
This compilation was simply made so I can quickly git clone my personal
vim settings onto newly install machines.

## Installation Instructions
`git clone https://github.com/NullMode/vim.git`

* This folder needs to be placed in the .vim directory in the users home.
* The install.sh file will sync the contends of the cloned folder to the users $HOME directory.
* General configuration is kept in the .vimrc file
